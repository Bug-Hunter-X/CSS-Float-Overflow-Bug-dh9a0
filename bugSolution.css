The most common solution is the clearfix technique. This involves adding a clearfix class to the parent container that clears the floats:

```css
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}
```

Apply this class to the parent container:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px;
  .clearfix
}

div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

Now, the parent container will automatically resize to accommodate the floated children.
