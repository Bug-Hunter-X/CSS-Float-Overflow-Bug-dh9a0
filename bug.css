The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue is that when the combined width of multiple `div` elements exceeds the width of their parent container, they will overflow the container, leading to layout problems.

This is due to the use of `float: left` which takes elements out of the normal flow.  The parent container doesn't automatically resize to accommodate the floating children.
